# Useful data

This repository contains somewhat specific datasets I have collected, usually while
doing correlation and predictive analysis on mobile market statistics - so don't expect to see datasets like
"Global warming impact on GDP by country" here any time soon. Or ever.
This data is mostly sourced from Wikipedia, though it might contain data from some other sources as well.

These datasets are available in JSON, with SQL versions located in `/sql/` directory.
